# Utilities for Laravel

This extension aims to bring many utility features for Laravel users.

Currently, I have completed only one feature. You can create a view file directly from the controller.

## Feature 1 - Create View File

How to create a view file directly from the controller?

![Feature 1 - Create View File](https://iili.io/HGRbBRV.gif)

- Just place your cursor in the `view name` inside the `view method`.
- Open command palate by pressing `Command + Shift + P` (on Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (on Windows)
- Search for `Laravel Utils: Create View File` and click on it
- It will create a blade view file and take you to that file
- If the blade file already exists, it will not create a new one.

- If you place your cursor outside the `view name`, it will ask you to place it in the correct position.
